# The-Odin-Project-Recipes
A website with links to various recipes. Made by NovusSocius, with the help of the Odin Project.

Hello world! I am NovusSocius, usually just called Novus. I recently started learning about web development and found out about the Odin Project. This is my first project, where, as mentioned before, I will be working on a website that will have multiple recipes (which I totally didn't "acquire" from the internet). Anyway, I hope this goes well.
P.S.: This is before I started working on the project itself, I'll add in some self-reflection later on.

Edit: Finally completed the project! It was pretty simple yet fun. I think I have now got a hang of HTML and should be able to
continue on without any hassle. Throughout the project, the only part I messed up at was not adding `rel="noopener noreferrer"` which I did add eventually. Other than that, the project went well and I can't wait to complete this [course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)!
