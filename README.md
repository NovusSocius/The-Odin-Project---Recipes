# The-Odin-Project---Recipes
A website with links to various recipes. Made by NovusSocius, with the help of the Odin Project.

Hello world! I am NovusSocius, usually just called Novus. I recently started learning about web development and found out about the Odin Project. This is my first project, where, as mentioned before, I will be working on a website which will have multiple recipes (which I totally didn't "acquire" from the internet). Anyways, I hope this goes well.
P.S.: This is before I started working on the project itself, I'll add in some self reflection later on.
