    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        I'll start off with what is without a doubt my <strong>favourite</strong> recipe <em>ever</em>. Fried chicken is a dish 
        consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with <em>seasoned flour</em> or <em>batter</em> and <em>pan-fried, 
        deep fried, pressure fried,or air fried</em>. The breading adds a <em>crisp coating</em> or crust to the exterior of the 
        chicken while <em>retaining juices in the meat</em>. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>
        We'll start off with the <strong>ingredients</strong> you'll need to have ready to make this <em>mazing dish</em>a:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: <em>Obviously.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong>: <em>Tenderizes the chicken</em>, without making it too tough.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: Gives the buttermilk and seasonings <em>something to stick to.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: You only need paprika, salt and pepper, however <em>feel free to add more!</em></li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>: Preferably vegetable oil as it has a <em>high smoke point.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>
        Now that we have prepared our ingredients, we finally arrive at the <em>fun part!</em> These are the steps to cook 
        delicious fried chicken:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the breading</strong>: Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dredge the chicken</strong>: Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until 
            it's completely soaked in buttermilk. Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to 
            coat. Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like 
            consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fry the chicken</strong>: Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, 
            then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and
            fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.
        </li>
    </ol>
