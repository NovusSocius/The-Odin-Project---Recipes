    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza is inarguably world's famous dish, and understandably so. The amount of options for toppings that you can put on it 
        in order to customize it to suit your tastes is amazing(EXPECT FOR PINEAPPLES! NEVER PUT THEM ON PIZZAS!). That being said,
        This is my personal favourite recipe when it comes to pizzas.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken, sweet Italian sausage, cremini mushrooms, fontina cheese, and sliced red bell pepper are just a few of the 
        ingredients we used to dress this dish up this homemade chicken pizza.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12-ounce) portion fresh pizza dough</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed</li>
        <li>1 (4-ounce) link sweet Italian sausage, casing removed</li>
        <li>¼ cup vertically sliced onion</li>
        <li>4 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornmeal</li>
        <li>4 ounces fontina cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Let dough rest, covered, at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450°F.</li>
    <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons oil, chicken, and sausage; sauté 5 minutes. Remove 
        mixture from pan. Add 1 tablespoon oil to pan; swirl. Add onion, mushrooms and garlic; sauté 5 minutes, stirring 
        constantly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Punch dough down. Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal. Roll dough out to a 14-inch circle on baking sheet. Brush 
        dough with 1 tablespoon oil; sprinkle with 2 ounces cheese. Arrange chicken mixture, vegetable mixture and bell 
        pepper over cheese, leaving a 1/4-inch border. Top with remaining cheese and crushed red pepper. Bake at 450°F for 
        20 minutes or until golden. Sprinkle with herbs. Cut into slices.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>And there you have it! A delicious pizza, ready to serve! Make sure you eat it while it's still hot!</p>
